### How to translate

steps:

 * Create a pull request for the language you are going to translate.
 * Translate the strings using the file "en_US.json" as the reference. To do that, you can open an existing file or create a new file within of this directory. The name of the file must follow this format: "language_REGION.json" (e.g. "en_US.json", "pt_BR.json", "ja_JA.json"), "language" must be lowercase and "region" must be uppercase.
